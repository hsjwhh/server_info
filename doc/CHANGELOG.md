## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed
- Updated root `README.md` with better navigation to documentation.
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude local `SESSION_NOTES.md` session notes file.
- Improved inline code comments across key scripts (`request`, route-driven detail loading, session cache, table interaction) and standardized API module JSDoc in `src/api/sn.js` and `src/api/filters.js`.
- Unified `src/pages/SettingsPage.vue` to project JavaScript style, added localStorage persistence (`appSettings`), refresh-interval normalization (5-3600), and responsive layout optimization.
- Added authenticated `/settings` route in `src/router/index.js` so header "个人设置" navigation resolves correctly.

### Removed
